## Installation

Get the repository (master branch) and run the following commands.

ng serve

```

## Requirements

Create a small CRUD application that will display all customer data, allow for editing of
an existing customer record and add a new customer.

The display should show all data in an intuitive and easy to use way. You have complete control over how you chose to present this information.

- The user should be able to click on an individual record and enter an edit mode. This can be done inline or as a separate page. 
- All values should be validated against the matrix below. 
- The user should be able to add a new customer record. This should be done by navigating to a new page. All values should be validated against the matrix below.
- If user navigates away from the page prior to submitting, the user should be prompted that they will lose all information and be given the ability to continue or stay on page.
- *the ‘other’ field is only required if ‘Other’ is selected in the title field.
- *more than one phone number should be allowed. This should be reflected in the
interface.

You may use Angular (please use version 8 or higher), Angular Material and RxJS for
this exercise.
No other 3rd party libraries/functions are allowed.
